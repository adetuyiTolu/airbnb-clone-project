  ## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

This project is built around several core entities to support the platform's functionality. Below is an overview of each entity, its key fields, and how the entities relate to one another.

### üìå Entities and Key Fields

#### 1. **User**
Represents the individuals who interact with the platform.
- `id`: Unique identifier for each user.
- `name`: Full name of the user.
- `email`: User's email address (used for login and communication).
- `password`: Hashed password for authentication.
- `role`: Specifies if the user is a guest or host.

#### 2. **Property**
Represents a listing available for booking.
- `id`: Unique identifier for the property.
- `title`: Name or title of the property.
- `description`: Detailed information about the property.
- `location`: Address or region where the property is located.
- `price_per_night`: Cost of staying per night.

#### 3. **Booking**
Represents a reservation made by a user.
- `id`: Unique booking reference.
- `user_id`: The guest who made the booking.
- `property_id`: The property being booked.
- `start_date`: Beginning of the reservation.
- `end_date`: End of the reservation.

#### 4. **Review**
Represents feedback left by a user after a stay.
- `id`: Unique identifier for the review.
- `user_id`: Reviewer (must have booked the property).
- `property_id`: The reviewed property.
- `rating`: Numerical rating (e.g., 1-5 stars).
- `comment`: Optional text feedback.

#### 5. **Payment**
Represents the financial transaction for a booking.
- `id`: Unique transaction reference.
- `booking_id`: Booking associated with the payment.
- `amount`: Total amount paid.
- `status`: Payment status (e.g., pending, completed, failed).
- `timestamp`: Date and time the payment was made.

---

### üîó Entity Relationships

- A **User** can list multiple **Properties** (if they are a host).
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings** (as a guest).
- A **Booking** is linked to one **Property** and one **User**.
- A **Review** is submitted by a **User** and linked to one **Property**.
- A **Payment** is tied to a single **Booking**.

These relationships ensure a scalable and well-structured system for managing listings, interactions, and transactions.

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. API Documentation
- **OpenAPI Standard**: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration for frontend developers and third-party services.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
- **GraphQL**: Enables flexible and efficient querying of backend data with precise control over requested fields.

### 2. User Authentication
- **Endpoints**: `/users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`
- **Features**: Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. Authentication is handled via token-based methods to protect endpoints and user data.

### 3. Property Management
- **Endpoints**: `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`
- **Features**: Users can create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. This feature forms the core functionality for hosts or real estate agents.

### 4. Booking System
- **Endpoints**: `/bookings/`, `/bookings/{booking_id}/`
- **Features**: Enables users to book properties, manage their reservations, and track check-in/check-out details. It ensures seamless coordination between users and property availability.

### 5. Payment Processing
- **Endpoints**: `/payments/`
- **Features**: Manages payment transactions related to bookings. Ensures secure processing and recording of financial interactions between users and property owners.

### 6. Review System
- **Endpoints**: `/reviews/`, `/reviews/{review_id}/`
- **Features**: Users can leave reviews on properties they've stayed in. This adds a feedback loop that helps maintain quality standards and transparency.

### 7. Database Optimizations
- **Indexing**: Frequently queried fields are indexed to speed up read operations and ensure responsiveness.
- **Caching**: Key responses are cached to reduce database load, enhance performance, and improve user experience.

## API Security

Ensuring the security of the API is a top priority to protect sensitive user data, prevent abuse, and maintain the integrity of the platform. The following key measures are implemented:

### 1. Authentication
- **Method**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure, stateless authentication.
- **Purpose**: Ensures only registered users can access protected endpoints and perform actions such as booking, listing properties, or making payments.

### 2. Authorization
- **Role-Based Access**: Different roles (e.g., admin, property owner, regular user) have controlled access to resources.
- **Purpose**: Prevents unauthorized users from performing restricted operations like deleting other users' data or modifying someone else's property.

### 3. Rate Limiting
- **Implementation**: Limits the number of requests from a single IP or user over a given period.
- **Purpose**: Protects the API from brute-force attacks, spamming, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

### 4. Data Validation & Sanitization
- **Method**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized using Django REST Framework serializers.
- **Purpose**: Prevents injection attacks, malformed data, and other security vulnerabilities at the input level.

### 5. HTTPS Enforcement
- **Implementation**: All communication between clients and the API is encrypted via HTTPS.
- **Purpose**: Secures data in transit, especially for login credentials, payment information, and personal user data.

### 6. Secure Payment Processing
- **Integration**: Payment data is handled by trusted third-party payment gateways.
- **Purpose**: Ensures compliance with financial security standards (e.g., PCI-DSS) and protects sensitive payment data from exposure.

### 7. Token Expiry & Refresh
- **JWT Management**: Access tokens have a short lifespan and can be refreshed using secure refresh tokens.
- **Purpose**: Minimizes the risk in case a token is leaked or compromised.

By combining these techniques, the platform ensures a secure environment for users to interact with listings, manage bookings, and process payments safely.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes to ensure high-quality software delivery. By integrating code frequently and deploying updates automatically, CI/CD helps catch bugs early, reduce manual errors, and accelerate the development lifecycle.

For this project, CI/CD pipelines can be implemented using tools such as:

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments by containerizing the application for both development and production.
- **Other CI/CD platforms**: Jenkins, CircleCI, GitLab CI, or AWS CodePipeline can also be used.

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline improves reliability, speeds up releases, and supports collaboration across development teams.
